# You-can-see-me: Image Information Reduction using Machine Learning and Statistics

## Overview

This project aims to reduce the noise in datasets by identifying and removing the bottom 10% of images in terms of information content. By applying a combination of machine learning and statistical techniques, we are able to enhance the quality of datasets, leading to better performance in various data-driven applications.

## Features

- **Noise Reduction**: Automatically identifies the least informative images in a dataset and removes them to reduce noise.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to assess the information content of images.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applies statistical methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of image filtering.

## Future Improvements

- **Support for Text and Audio**: Planned future versions will include the capability to process and clean text and audio data, extending the benefits of noise reduction beyond images.
- **Enhanced Algorithms**: Ongoing work to refine the machine learning models and statistical methods for even more precise identification of low-information data.
